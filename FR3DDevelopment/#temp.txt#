PROGRAM CHANGE REQUEST FORM

This sheet is an overview of the content and format of proposals for a new undergraduate program, or for elimination or modification of an existing program. Most program changes must be reviewed by Undergraduate Council and, in some cases, by the Board of Trustees and/or the Ohio Board of Regents. As a result, a proposal for program changes should generally be prepared in consultation with the Office of the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost. Some of  the information in the proposal must be summarized on the COURSE/CURRICULUM MODIFICATION REQUEST cover sheet (“blue sheet”) that will accompany it through the approval process. Depending on the nature of the request, it may not be necessary to provide all the information below. Please use your own responses to the checkbox items on the “blue sheet” as a guide for deciding which items below are relevant to your proposal. Please use the outline headings shown below to prepare your document; omit any that do not apply.

A.	THE MODIFICATION
1.	For all proposals: Describe briefly the nature of the proposed change. 
     

The curriculum modification process is intended to change program requirements as represented in the Undergraduate Catalog and on checksheets. For this reason, all curriculum modifications for new programs or program revisions must include:
1.1	A checksheet that shows and highlights the proposed change(s). (Please make the changes on the checksheet obvious, preferable with revision markings).
1.2	Catalog pages (printed from the current version of the online catalog) showing the proposed changes. (Please use revision markings or some other device to make changes obvious). If a new program is being proposed, then new catalog copy should be submitted. Care should be taken to ensure that the proposed changes to the catalog match the proposed changes to the checksheet.

2.	List courses to be taken out of program requirements. (If courses are to be eliminated from course inventory, submit a separate “course change” for that action).
     

3.	List courses to be added to program requirements. (If new courses are to be added to course inventory, submit a separate “course change” for that action).
     

4.	For proposals to make major changes to program requirements: Describe any change to the sequence of courses within a major/minor/area of specialization/certificate.
     

5.	Will this change result in modification of student learning outcomes?	0	yes	0	no
If yes, list all changes to the student learning outcomes related to the curriculum modification and describe the plan for assessing those outcomes.
     

6.	Program changes approved before the January deadline for the Catalog update will be recorded in the Catalog and will be in effect for checksheets in the fall of that year.

B.	RATIONALE [Required for all proposals]:
1.	Reason/Need for the change. For new programs, explain how this fits with the Academic Plan.
     

2.	Student implications (describe the basis for each estimate)
2.1	Prospective demand for a new degree/major/minor (level of student interest).
     
2.2	Effect on required hours in degree/major/minor.
     
2.3	Number of students affected and in what way.
     
2.4	Effect on elective hours of majors/minors.
     
2.5	If a degree/major/minor is to be eliminated, how will current students in the program be accommodated?
     
2.6	If requirements for matriculation from a pre-major program are to be added or modified, how will those changes affect student enrollment and progress toward graduation?
     
2.7	Is this a degree program whose normal time to degree is something other than four calendar years for a baccalaureate degree and two calendar years for an associate degree? If so, how many hours/years to obtain the degree?
     

C.	IMPLICATIONS FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS [For all proposals]:
1.	How will the proposed change affect the integrity of other programs to which it is related, including the demand for courses or degrees in other programs

1.2	in the college?
     
1.3	in other university departments/colleges?
     
1.4	at other universities?
     

2.	What individuals in other departments/schools/colleges, if any, have been consulted about this proposal? [attach correspondence where appropriate]
     

3.	What effect will the proposed change have on accreditation of this program or of associated programs in the college/university?
     

4.	What effect will the proposed change have on the ability of the department/school/college/university to meet goals for recruitment, retention, and diversity?
     

D.	STAFFING IMPLICATIONS/QUALIFICATIONS
1.	For new programs, or if an existing degree/major/minor/area of specialization is to be modified: Are faculty and staff with expertise available now?  0	yes  	0	no 
If not, how will they be identified/recruited?       

2.	For all proposals:  How will this change affect the allocation of faculty and staff in the department/school/college?      

3.	For all proposals:  How will this change affect faculty work load?      

E.	AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES

2.	For all proposals: Indicate any new one-time or continuing costs for materials, equipment, services, or personnel directly associated with a new or modified curriculum.
