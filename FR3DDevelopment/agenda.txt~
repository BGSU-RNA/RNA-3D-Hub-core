PSU and probably others have the connection to the backbone moved to
another atom.  This complicates the proper display of the glycosidic bond.
It makes it hard to know how to orient the base properly in 3D.  It makes
it hard to know about isostericity.  It makes it questionable how to
determine basepairing (probably best to use the same standard position as
U, but what effect may the different glycosidic bond have then?)  It will
still allow basepairs on the Watson-Crick edge, but now not the Hoogsteen
edge.  New pairs will be allowed on the sugar edge, I guess.
