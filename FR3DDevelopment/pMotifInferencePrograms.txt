
Put all motifs (.mat files) in a folder called MotifLibrary.

loopType = 'IL';

This tells JAR3D that you are interested in Internal loops.  Or use HL.

pMakeModelsFromLibrary

This will make JAR3D models and write them in the Models folder.
The folder will be created if it doesn't already exist.
It will write out .fasta files in a Sequences folder.

pEstAllModelScoreDistrs

This will generate 100,000 random sequences for each model, using the right
length distribution, score these sequences against the model, and write out
data to be used to calculate quantiles.

Separated = 0;

This tells JAR3D to run group-group comparisons.

pJAR3DAllVersusAll

This will parse the .fasta files with all sequences for each motif against
all models.  

pDisplayModelScores

This will illustrate how well each model recognizes its own sequences.

pSeparateSearches

This will write .fasta files for each individual sequence.

Separated = 1;

This tells JAR3D to run individual-group comparisons.

pJAR3DAllVersusAll

This will parse the .fasta files with all individual sequences for each
motif against all models.

pDisplayModelScores

Diagnostics for individual-group

pCompareTopQuantiles

This takes a long time to run.  It seeks to compare the degree of overlap
between the high quantiles of different models.


% Example:
% Scores = JAR3DMatlab.MotifParseSingle(pwd,'IL_225_test2.fasta','IL_225_05_cWW-cWW-cSH');
% S = JAR3DMatlab.MotifTestGeneral(pwd,'IL','IL_test.txt','IL_test.txt');
