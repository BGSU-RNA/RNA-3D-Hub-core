"""This module contains things that store experimental sequences. We only
handle RNA experimental sequences. Experimental sequences are the unique
sequences that are used in experiments. They are not the sequence observed in
the model as the modeled sequence may have gaps. Using this makes doing all
alignments much easier and take less space.
